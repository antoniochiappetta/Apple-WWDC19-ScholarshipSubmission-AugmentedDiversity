 # Hi man!
 
 My name is Antonio and I'm gonna tell you something about [human diversity](glossary://Human diversity).
 Many people don't appreciate who is different from them, they don't like people with a different skin color or coming from a different country. But everyone has something special to offer!
 
 Look at me! I'm italian and I have very special things to offer you!

 1. First of all, to enable the interactions with me and *start learning*, tap on *Run My Code*.
 2. Then try to long press on me and see what I can show you: I chose a *skill*, a *place* and a *dish* that are typical of my country.
 3. Every time you choose an option, you will understand once more why you should visit Italy!
